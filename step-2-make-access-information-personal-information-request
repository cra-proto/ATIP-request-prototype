        <h3>Online</h3>
<p>You must send access to information and privacy (ATIP) requests to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) through the new <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/request-information.html">ATIP Online Request Service (AORS)</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest and most secure way to receive your records is by creating an AORS account. This will give you access to free features, including the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive a copy of your records electronically</li>
<li>access the status of your requests</li>
<li>communicate directly with the Access to Information and Privacy Directorate</li>
</ul>
<h3>By mail</h3>
<p>Send everything listed under <a href="#request">What you need to provide to make a request</a> in your letter or completed <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc378.html">Form RC378, Access to Information and Personal Information Request Form</a> to the following address:</p>
<p>Director General, ATIP Directorate<br>
Canada Revenue Agency<br>
555 MacKenzie Avenue, 5th Floor<br>

        <h2>Ways to receive requested records</h2>
<h3>Electronically</h3>
<p>To receive your response package electronically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an ATIP Online Request Service (AORS) account when you <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/request-information.html">fill out your request</a>, and</li>
<li>Select “Electronic – to your ATIP online account” as your preferred method to get your records.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to continue as an AORS guest, you will have to create a <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/cpc/doc/en/postal-services/epost-connect-participant-guide-en.pdf">Connect</a> account to receive records for your ATIP request. The CRA uses Canada Post’s secure online platform Connect to send records that you cannot receive through the AORS. This service is safe and free.</p>
<h3>By paper</h3>
<p>The requested records will be mailed using <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/cpc/en/business/shipping/canada/compare/xpresspost.page">Xpresspost™</a>&nbsp;to the mailing address provided. <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/cpc/en/business/shipping/canada/compare/xpresspost.page">Xpresspost™</a> tracks packages and has a 2 day delivery guarantee. If delivery of the records is unsuccessful, an ATIP analyst may contact you to verify your address.</p>
